# High Level Roadmap

This purpose of this library is to offer as many GraphQL features in a short amount of time.
It is based on the official [spec][1]. The list of supported features are listed here.
Potential but bot critic features are also listed here.

## Library components

Here is a basic list of library's components.

- `GraphQLClient`: Used to instantiate a GraphQL client using a **network transport**.
This client is almost the only thing that you need to use. It posts request to a **graphql endpont** using a 
GQL query you built and is handling reconciliation between the HTTP response and the query type.
- `QueryBuilder`: Used to transform a GQL query into a string
- `QueryReconcilier`: Used to transform an HTTP response into a GQL populated query
