# graphql_client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hourliert/graphql_client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hourliert/graphql_client)

UPDATE: 
---
**I am not actively working on the project at the moment. I would be more than happy to receive contributions and/or grant release permission to someone else.** I like the dart ecosystem and I'd love to see a mature GraphQL library for it. I unfortunately don't have enough time to work on the project at the moment ‚òπÔ∏è.

GraphQL Client written in Dart üéØ.
